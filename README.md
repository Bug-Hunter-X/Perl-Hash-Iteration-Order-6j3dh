This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug related to the unpredictable order of hash iteration. The `bug.pl` file shows code that relies on a specific hash iteration order which is not guaranteed, leading to incorrect output. The `bugSolution.pl` demonstrates how to iterate through the hash using `sort` to guarantee a consistent order if needed, or how to process the hash without depending on order.
